# Dupras - Technology Probes Study (OU 0612)


This study is a research project conducted in the course of my PhD research at the Open University. My research seeks to find out ways that we can program computers by playing musical instruments.

This study is about how musicians interact with a simple prototype programming system that allows the user to program simple musical operations by playing a MIDI keyboard. Participants in this study should be able to play a musical instrument (any), and have access to a MIDI controller (e.g. MIDI keyboard), a computer, and a means to record voice notes.

If you are interested in participating in this study, please follow this [link](jiscsurvey) which will give you more information and allow you to join. 

## How long will this take?


Besides reading some information and filling a consent form, the study should take you between 30 minutes and an hour. I will also invite you to have post-study interview which may last 15-30 minutes.

## What do I need?


To participate, you need the following:
- a computer capable of running PureData. macOS, Windows and Linux are all good choices
- a MIDI controller (or two). You can use a MIDI keyboard, or a MIDI guitar, or anything that can produce MIDI notes and can interface with your computer. If you have a foot controller or other controller you want to use alongside, that is possible and encouraged
- a means to record an audio commentary ("audio journal"). A mobile phone app is perfectly adequate, as long as you can save the file and send it to me.
 
## Is this confidential?

Yes. Other than the consent form (which I need to record proof of your consent), all your data will be anonymised and redacted, such that it can't be traced back to you.

## What if I change my mind?

You can withdraw from the study at any time until the data is being used in the study. More information in the **participant information**.
